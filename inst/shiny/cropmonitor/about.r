    tags$p('AmeriFlux is a network of PI-managed sites measuring ecosystem CO',tags$sub('2'),', water, and energy fluxes in North and South America. It was established to connect research on field sites representing major climate and ecological biomes, including tundra, grasslands, savanna, crops, and conifer, deciduous, and tropical forests. As a grassroots, investigator-driven network, the AmeriFlux community has tailored instrumentation to suit each unique ecosystem. This “coalition of the willing” is diverse in its interests, use of technologies and collaborative approaches. As a result, the AmeriFlux Network continually pioneers new ground.'),
    tags$p('The network was launched in 1996, after an international workshop on flux measurements in La Thuile, Italy, in 1995, where some of the first year-long flux measurements were presented. Early support for the network came from many sources, including the U.S. Department of Energy Terrestrial Carbon Program, the DOE’s National Institute of Global Environmental Change (NIGEC), NASA, NOAA and the US Forest Service. The network grew from about 15 sites in 1997 to more than 110 active sites registered today. Sixty-one other sites, now inactive, have flux data stored in the network database. In 2012, the U.S. DOE established the AmeriFlux Management Project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) to support the broad AmeriFlux community and the AmeriFlux sites.'),
    tags$p('AmeriFlux is now one of the DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research’s (BER) best-known and most highly regarded brands in climate and ecological research. AmeriFlux datasets, and the understanding derived from them, provide crucial linkages between terrestrial ecosystem processes and climate-relevant responses at landscape, regional, and continental scales.'),

    tags$p('Those who use AmeriFlux Network data for their research are strongly encouraged to acknowledge both the site principal investigators who contributed the data they use, and the support that the AmeriFlux Network data processing and archival receive from the U.S. DOE. Suggested acknowledgment: We acknowledge the following AmeriFlux sites for their data records: site IDs. In addition, funding for AmeriFlux data resources was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science.')
